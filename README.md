# Ci Cache Presentation 
This is a Rails application, initially generated using [Potassium](https://github.com/platanus/potassium) by Platanus.

## Local installation

Assuming you've just cloned the repo, run this script to setup the project in your
machine:

    $ ./bin/setup

It assumes you have a machine equipped with Ruby, Node.js, Docker and make.

The script will do the following among other things:

- Install the dependecies
- Create a docker container for your database
- Prepare your database
- Adds heroku remotes

After the app setup is done you can run it with [Heroku Local]

    $ heroku local

[Heroku Local]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-local


## Continuous Integrations

The project is setup to run tests
in [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/platanus/ci-cache-presentation/tree/master)

You can also run the test locally simulating the production environment using docker.
Just make sure you have docker installed and run:

    bin/cibuild


## Style Guides

Style guides are enforced through a CircleCI [job](.circleci/config.yml) with [reviewdog](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog) as a reporter, using per-project dependencies and style configurations.
Please note that this reviewdog implementation requires a GitHub user token to comment on pull requests. A token can be generated [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens), and it should have at least the `repo` option checked.
The included `config.yml` assumes your CircleCI organization has a context named `org-global` with the required token under the environment variable `REVIEWDOG_GITHUB_API_TOKEN`.

The project comes bundled with configuration files available in this repository.

Linting dependencies like `rubocop` or `rubocop-rspec` must be locked in your `Gemfile`. Similarly, packages like `eslint` or `eslint-plugin-vue` must be locked in your `package.json`.

You can add or modify rules by editing the [`.rubocop.yml`](.rubocop.yml), [`.eslintrc.json`](.eslintrc.json) or [`.stylelintrc.json`](.stylelintrc.json) files.

You can (and should) use linter integrations for your text editor of choice, using the project's configuration.


## Sending Emails

The emails can be send through the gem `send_grid_mailer` using the `sendgrid` delivery method.
All the `action_mailer` configuration can be found at `config/mailer.rb`, which is loaded only on production environments.

All emails should be sent using background jobs, by default we install `sidekiq` for that purpuse.

#### Testing in staging

If you add the `EMAIL_RECIPIENTS=` environmental variable, the emails will be intercepted and redirected to the email in the variable.


## Internal dependencies

### Authentication

We are using the great [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) library by [PlataformaTec](http://plataformatec.com.br/)

### File Storage

For managing uploads, this project uses [Shrine](https://github.com/shrinerb/shrine).

### Rails pattern enforcing types

This projects uses [Power-Types](https://github.com/platanus/power-types) to generate Services, Commands, Utils and Values.

### API Support

This projects uses [Power API](https://github.com/platanus/power_api). It's a Rails engine that gathers a set of gems and configurations designed to build incredible REST APIs.

### Error Reporting

To report our errors we use [Sentry](https://github.com/getsentry/raven-ruby)

### Administration

This project uses [Active Admin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin) which is a Ruby on Rails framework for creating elegant backends for website administration.



### Scheduled Tasks

To schedule recurring work at particular times or dates, this project uses [Sidekiq Scheduler](https://github.com/moove-it/sidekiq-scheduler)

### Queue System

For managing tasks in the background, this project uses [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq)

## Seeds

To populate your database with initial data you can add, inside the `/db/seeds.rb` file, the code to generate **only the necessary data** to run the application.
If you need to generate data with **development purposes**, you can customize the `lib/fake_data_loader.rb` module and then to run the `rake load_fake_data` task from your terminal.


## Development

For hot-reloading and fast webpacker compilation you need to run webpack's dev server along with the rails server:

    $ ./bin/webpack-dev-server

Running the dev server will also solve problems with the cache not refreshing between changes and provide better error messages if something fails to compile.

For even faster in-place component refreshing (with no page reloads), you can enable Hot Module Reloading in `config/webpacker.yml`

    development:
      dev_server:
        hmr: true
